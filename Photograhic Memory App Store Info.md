# What to test

Take 1 or more photos with HDR turned on with the system camera, or take a screenshot (power + home button).

These photos should show up in a list in the app, in the all tab.

Tapping a photo should allow you to see it full screen. Tapping it again should shrink it back to the list.

If you have no HDR photos in your camera roll, you should see a blank state message.

You can swipe a table cell to give a photo a title. You can also add or remove a photo from the favorites tab this way.

Searching will filter by table cells whose title has a prefix of the query. Searching for the empty string will clear the search.
